# Move Enqueued Scripts (WIP)

> A simple WordPress plugin that will allow users to move enqueued scripts out of the head and into the footer.


### To-Do

- Change the functionality to EXCLUDE checked items from the footer
- Move `set_front_end_scripts()` to it's own file that is ran on the front end
- Only run the rest of the code when `is_admin()`
